**Hi there!** I don't really know what to write here, lol. Around a month ago I got myself the cheapest domain money can buy to host a project on one of the subdomains, but now I finally got time to do something with root domain, so I decided to make a blog here!

Writing this post to test how I set things up, because anything I make tends to completely break if not tested. Some stuff I should test is _italic_, **bold**, ~~strike-trough~~, [links (this is definitely not a rickroll)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), `inline code`,

```rust
print!("this fancy code block thingy with language formatting,");
```

And I guess that's it, bye!
